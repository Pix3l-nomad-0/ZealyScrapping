# 🔧 Fixed Deployment Guide

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Railway Service Not Working
**Problem**: Railway service returns 404 for `/scrape` endpoint
**Solution**: Enhanced logging and error handling in browser-service

### 2. API Endpoint Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Different files had different endpoint paths
**Solution**: Standardized all endpoints to use `/scrape`

### 3. Missing Deployment Scripts
**Problem**: No proper Railway deployment script
**Solution**: Created `deploy-railway.sh` script

## 🚀 Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Railway Service
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
cd /Volumes/HomeX/Users/Ternoa/_DEV/__TADA/ZealyScrapping

# Run the Railway deployment script
./deploy-railway.sh
```

### Step 2: Test Railway Service
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://zealyscrapping.railway.app/health

# Test scrape endpoint
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"slugs":["pofucoin"]}' \
  https://zealyscrapping.railway.app/scrape
```

### Step 3: Deploy Netlify Frontend
```bash
# Deploy to Netlify
./deploy.sh
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Railway Service Issues
1. **Check Railway logs**: Go to Railway dashboard → Your project → Deployments → Latest deployment → Logs
2. **Verify deployment**: Make sure the browser-service directory is properly deployed
3. **Check environment**: Ensure Node.js 18+ is being used

### Netlify Function Issues
1. **Check function logs**: Go to Netlify dashboard → Your site → Functions → scrape → Logs
2. **Verify function deployment**: Make sure `netlify/functions/scrape.ts` is deployed
3. **Test function locally**: Use `netlify dev` to test locally

### Common Error Messages

#### "Railway service is not responding properly"
- Railway service is down or not deployed
- Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
- Redeploy using `./deploy-railway.sh`

#### "Method not allowed"
- Frontend is calling wrong endpoint
- Ensure frontend calls `/api/scrape` (Netlify function)
- Netlify function calls `/scrape` (Railway service)

#### "Too many slugs"
- Limit is 50 slugs per request
- Split large requests into smaller batches

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

### Test Data
```

aynigold
```

### Expected Results
- Website links extracted
- Social media links (Discord, Twitter, Telegram) identified
- CSV download functionality working
- Error handling for failed scrapes

## 📞 Support

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check all logs** (Railway + Netlify)
2. **Verify URLs** are accessible
3. **Test with single slug** first
4. **Check browser console** for frontend errors

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ Railway service responds to `/health`  
✅ Railway service responds to `/scrape`  
✅ Netlify function proxies requests correctly  
✅ Frontend can submit slugs and get results  
✅ CSV download works  
✅ Error handling works properly  

## 🚨 Emergency Fix

If everything is broken, run this complete reset:

```bash
# 1. Redeploy Railway
./deploy-railway.sh

# 2. Wait 2 minutes for deployment

# 3. Test Railway
curl https://zealyscrapping.railway.app/health

# 4. Deploy Netlify
./deploy.sh

# 5. Test complete flow
# Go to your Netlify URL and test with sample data
```
